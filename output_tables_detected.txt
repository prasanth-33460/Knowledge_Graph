Scope of The Guideline
This document is intended to provide guidance on the format of a registration
application for drug products regarding ASEAN CTR. This format is
appropriate for NCE (New Chemical Entity), Biotech (Biotechnological
Products), MaV (Major Variations), MiV (Minor Variations) and G (Generics).
To determine the applicability of this format for a particular type of product,
applicant should consult with the appropriate National Regulatory
Authorities. The “Body of Data” in this guideline merely indicates where
the information should be located. Neither the type nor extent of specific
supporting data has been addressed in this guideline and both may depend
upon national guidance and or accepted leading international references
(pharmacopoeias).
For NCE and Biotech requirements please refer to the relevant ICH
Guidelines.
